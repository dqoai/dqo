# DQO AI

## Who we are
We are a team of data scientists and data engineers, working on Data Quality and Data Observability projects 
for years.

We have delivered thousands of data quality tests that are detecting anomalies and predicting possible issues using AI. 
We are
building Data Quality scorecards to track the KPIs. We have monitored the data on all mayor cloud providers (AWS, GCP,
Azure). We are monitoring tables up to a petabyte scale on a daily basis.

## DQO.ai
DQO.ai is an open-source data observability tool that handles data quality analysis for you.

It comes with predefined data checks – SQL queries, and rules – python functions, that evaluate the results.

You can modify existing checks and rules, or create the new ones, based on your needs.

All you need to do is set a configuration in YAML file.

See how to use DQO.ai on end to end [examples on bigquery public data]().
